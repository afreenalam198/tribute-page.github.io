              BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment. The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.

              Their incredible fanbase named 'ARMY' has been an immense factor in gaining the group the unprecendented success that they have experienced and the boys never fail to acknowledge that. Through their positive and relatable message, the boys of BTS have been able to connect with millions of people around the globe. Combined with their amazing music, visuals, message, social media interactions as well as numerous contents, BTS have managed to grow their fandom into a formidable 'ARMY' and the fandom continues to grow as BTS gets more main stream exposure in the western market.
